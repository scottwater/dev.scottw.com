With all that is going on in the stock market and economy for the last couple weeks, this headline cracked me up.

The market situation today is not the same as what happened in the dotcom era, but it is still comical for Facebook to state we will get to the business part of it later. There are very few long term success stories (Google) using the "_figure it out later_" strategy.

With the bleak market outlook for the next couple of years, I think Facebook will be kicking themselves for missing a major opportunity in about three years.
