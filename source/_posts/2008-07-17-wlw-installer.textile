I was trying to install Windows Live Writer on a new windows box and was greeted with something I thought had been put to rest many years ago.

What's wrong here?

All three options are checked by default. I am OK with the option to help improve the application, but do you really need to change my default search provider and even worse change my home page?

I understand that it costs money to develop Windows Live Writer, but this is crappy way to go about it.
