Friday (February 25th) will be my last day at "Telligent":http://telligent.com. There are a variety of reasons for making this move, but it really comes down to fulfilling my "obligations":http://scottw.com/life/obligation.

I have been a part of many great accomplishments at Telligent, but what I am most proud of is the stellar development team we put together. I have had the distinct pleasure to work with some extraordinary people and for that I will always be extremely grateful. 

Over the next couple of weeks I will share a bit more about what I intend to do in the future. For now, it is just time to say good bye and prepare to start building something awesome.
