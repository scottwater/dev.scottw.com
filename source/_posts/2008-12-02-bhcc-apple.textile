"Others are starting":http://arcware.net/bloggers-holiday-charity-challenge/ to get involved in the "Bloggers Holiday Charity Challenge":http://scottw.com/life/ebhcc/ and not using eBay, so it is time to drop eBay from the name.

bq. I'm donating all of my Lounge ad network earnings for November and December to our local food bank [1]*....*And not only that, but after talking with "James":http://infozerk.com/averyblog/, "he's decided to sweeten the deal":http://twitter.com/averyj/status/1032473873 by donating his portion of revenue of any blogger in "The Lounge":http://theloungenet.com/Home who does the same thing. That's pretty cool. ["Dave Donaldson":http://arcware.net/bloggers-holiday-charity-challenge/]

A big early things to Dave, James, and any other "Lounge":http://theloungenet.com/Home blogger who takes James up on the deal!

I am still moving forward with my eBay listings. Today's theme is Apple.
