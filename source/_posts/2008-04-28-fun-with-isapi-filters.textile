I am a big fan of ISAPI filters and "ISAPI_Rewrite":http://www.isapirewrite.com/ in particular. If you are not familiar with ISAPI filters and ISAPI_Rewrite, in a nutshell:

bq. ISAPI_Rewrite is a powerful URL manipulation engine based on regular expressions. It acts mostly like Apache's mod_Rewrite, but is designed specifically for Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS).

For $99 a server, you cannot go wrong (although there is a nice "free open source version as well":http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IIRF.aspx.)

There are many SEO and redirect usages of the product. One of my favorites is cleaning up and simplifying urls to make them more readable and emailable.

<pre><code class="xml">
RewriteRule /search/([a-zA-Z0-9\-\._:]*?)/ /search/?q=$1 [I,L]
RewriteRule /search/([a-zA-Z0-9\-\._:]*?)/\?p=(\d+) /search/?q=$1&p=$2 [I,L]
</code></pre>

Using the example code above, I can now build and share search links in my blog (using Graffiti) like this: "http://scottw.com/search/graffiti/":http://scottw.com/search/graffiti/ (instead of http://scottw.com/search/?q=graffiti). I won't go into all of the ins and outs of ISAPI_Rewrite, but basically:

* Declare a new rule
* Provide a regex pattern
* Provide a url to direct the request to (in this case the Graffiti search url)
* (optional) Add parameters/settings
