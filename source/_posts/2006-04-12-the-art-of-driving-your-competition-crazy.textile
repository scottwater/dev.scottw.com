I did not bring enough to read with me on vacation. I have been told there is a book store in Zurich which sells books in English, so hopefully I will find some time to head downtown.

In the mean time, I am finally getting caught up on older items in my aggregator. One that I missed a couple weeks ago is Guy Kawasaki's "The Art of Driving Your Competition Crazy":http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/03/the_art_of_driv.html. In his usual list style, Guy lists eight great tips. Tip #5, _Turn customers into evangelists_ should be fairly obvious, but I think it is very often overlooked.
