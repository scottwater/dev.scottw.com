bq. _I'm excited today to announce that we are also releasing the ASP.NET MVC source code under the Microsoft Public License (MS-PL). The MS-PL is an OSI-approved open source license.  The MS-PL contains no platform restrictions and provides broad rights to modify and redistribute the source code._ ["Scott Guthrie":http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/04/01/asp-net-mvc-1-0.aspx]

This is a huge step forward. It will be interesting to see how the community reacts to this in the comming months.

One obvious place you can expect to see this leveraged is by the "Mono":http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page folks.
