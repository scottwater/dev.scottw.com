According to various news "sources":http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/16986120/detail.html, Randy Pausch has lost his battle with cancer. I had been meaning to write something about Mr. Pausch's inspirational "Last Lecture video":http://youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo and his book "The Last Lecture":http://www.amazon.com/Last-Lecture-Randy-Pausch/dp/1401323251/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216992329&amp;sr=8-1.

Here are a couple of the things from his Last Lecture which will hopefully stick with me for a long time:

* "The head fake"
* Brick Walls - they are not there to stop us. They are there to let us prove how badly we want something.
* "We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand"
* Why? Never ask one word questions.
* "When you're screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they've given up on you"

I never heard of Mr. Pausch before he got sick, but I am sure I will remember him a long time to come.
