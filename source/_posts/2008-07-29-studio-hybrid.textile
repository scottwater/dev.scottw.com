bq. The system is described as the company's "first step" in eco-friendly PCs and uses notebook components to dramatically reduce both its size and power draw;

Personally, the design isn't doing anything for me, but I love basic concept of a small consumer friendly machine which takes the best from a laptop and puts it in a desktop. This typically happens the other way around. Throw in the eco-benefits and this could be a winner.
