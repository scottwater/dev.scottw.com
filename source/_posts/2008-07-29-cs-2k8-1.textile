"Josh":http://evolvingwe.com/ gives the low down on what you can expect to "see in Community Server 2008.1":http://evolvingwe.com/software/locking-down-community-server-2008-1/.

Quick Summary:

* Themes - Hawaii is getting a really nice make over.
* Q&A - This is a killer forums feature which needed a little love to put it over the top. If you use your forums for support, this will be a game changer for you.
* Wiki - This is our V1 wiki. It is very usable and will be base of some really innovative things in 2009.
* Mail Gateway - this is an older feature, but it got a much needed tune up. We are using it religiously inside "Telligent":http://telligent.com today and it has really changed things for us in a big way.
* Evolution - Community Server for the intranet. Again, this is very solid, but I am already giddy thinking about what is going to be in v.Next. :)
