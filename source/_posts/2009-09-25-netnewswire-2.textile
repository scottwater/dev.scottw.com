I have tried a variety of tools for reading my Google Reader feeds on my iPhone.

* Google's mobile browser - works well, but requires a constant connection and little third party tool integration
* Feeds - likely the most disappointing app I have ever purchased
* Byline - pretty good overall experience. A little rough around the edges.
* Newsstand - relatively new. My first day with it was good, but it was downhill after that.

However, with the recent update of the "NetNewsWire iPhone app":http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswireiphone/default.aspx, all the applications listed above are dead to me. NewNewsWire for the iPhone may be the best application I have used on my iPhone.

Here is what it does really well:

*Sync* - it is fast, allows you to opt out of certain feeds, and unlike other tools I have tried it just works.

"*Instapaper*":http://instapaper.com- the Instapaper integration is flawless. Even better, if you do click a link from with in a post, you can add that specific page to Instapaper as well.

"*Twitter*":http://twitter.com/scottw - the twitter integration is almost flawless as well. However, I would love to use bit.ly instead of TinyUrl.

*Navigation* - very easy to move around, quick access to the next unread feed

*Beautiful* - no weird wood grains/etc. Just good access to the content you want.

*River of News* - easy access to new posts from the last 24 hours.

*Cost* - Free with ads and $1.99 to remove the ads.

Even if you prefer using Google Reader in a browser on your desktop, you really need to check this application out. I am 100% certain I will be reading a lot more RSS content in the coming weeks because of this application.
