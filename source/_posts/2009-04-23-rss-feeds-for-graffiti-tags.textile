Or put another way, when a feature does not really exist.

I always thought "Graffiti":http://graffiticms.com had support for RSS feeds per tag. But it turns out that while we have RSS autodiscovery for these feeds, they are never generated by Graffiti.

A couple users pinged us this week about this feature. Unfortunately, it is not on the current feature roadmap, so I figured I would put together a simple example and publish it here.

If you would like to add support for RSS feeds per tag within your Graffiti site, you can now "download the this httphandler":http://www.box.net/shared/5vrz09dbz8. To use it, just unzip it and add the tagrss.ashx to your site (I recommend the root). Then it is just a matter of adding a "tag" querystring to it. For example, all of my posts on Windows Live Writer can be found at http://scottw.com/tagrss.ashx?tag=wlw

This is very simple implementation that is roughly a copy & paste job of some existing code. It does handle caching, filtering by the last 10 results, and 304 status codes. Unfortunately, at this moment, _it does *not* honor category permissions_. So if you have public and private categories, this example is not for you.

Finally, if you find the url above a bit fugly and would have access to a rewrite component like "ISAPI Rewrite":http://www.helicontech.com/isapi_rewrite/, you can add the following rule: _RewriteRule ^/tags/(.+)/feed/ /tagrss.ashx?tag=$1 [NC, L]_. With this in place, the tag url above can be accessed at "http://scottw.com/tags/wlw/feed/ which falls in line with the rest of Graffiti (you should be able to achieve a similar result with "ASP.Net Routing":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx or "URL Rewrite module for IIS7":http://ruslany.net/2009/04/url-rewrite-module-11-for-iis-7/).

*Update:*
Since I am no longer running this site on Graffiti, the links to this site above will no longer work.
