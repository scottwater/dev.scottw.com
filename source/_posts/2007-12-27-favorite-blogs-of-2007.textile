While I did not set out to do it purposely, through out 2007 my blog reading habits have been changing quite a bit. I have been moving away from the geeky programming type blogs and more towards blogs about life, business, and productivity.

Two of the better blogs I started reading in 2007 are "Dumb Little Man":http://www.dumblittleman.com and "zen habits":http://zenhabits.net. They both offer great advice and have challenged and changed how I see the world. I do not think you can ask for more from a blog.

I am not going to tag people and start a meme, but I am curious to see what others have found this year. *Anyone else want to share a new favorite blog or two?*
