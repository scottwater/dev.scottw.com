My taste in podcasts varies by what is actually going on in my life. Right now it is mostly startups ([KickoffLabs](http://www.kickofflabs.com)) and Ruby.

Here are my current favorites:

__[The Lifestyle Business Podcast](http://www.lifestylebusinesspodcast.com/)__ 

Don't let the name full you. These guys are seriously focused on solid business skills. I have only been listening to them for a month or two, but it is one the few podcasts I now listen to every week. 

Two recent episodes stand out to me: 

1. [9 Tough Truths About Running a Business and Changing Your Life](http://www.lifestylebusinesspodcast.com/tough-truths-about-business/). 
1. [The Tao of the Hustle](http://www.lifestylebusinesspodcast.com/define-hustle/)

__[Mixergy](http://mixergy.com)__ 

Mixergy might be the podcast I have been subscribed to the longest. What I really like about Mixergy is the mix interviews: Founders of big and small companies, VCs, and everyone in-between. 

Recent favorites: 

1. [Curbly’s Founder Tells Me To Stop Ignoring Lifestyle Businesses – with Bruno Bornsztein](http://mixergy.com/bruno-bornsztein-curbly-interview/)
1. [Molehill’s Founder: Aim For Lifestyle, Not A Jackpot – with Tom Rossi](http://mixergy.com/tom-rossi-molehill-interview/)
1. [How To Build A Profitable Lifestyle Web App, Even If You’re Not A Developer – with Dane Maxwell](http://mixergy.com/paperless-pipeline-maxwell-interview/)
1. [Pitch Anything](http://mixergy.com/oren-klaff-pitch-anything-interview/) 
1. [Leadership Through Stories?! – with Derek Sivers](http://mixergy.com/derek-sivers-blog-interview/)

_Note: Looks like the last two require a premium membership_.

__[Ruby 5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/)__

Quick and concise updates on what is going in the Ruby world. Published twice a week and as you might guess, they are about 5 minutes long. 

__[RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/)__

[Ryan Bates](http://twitter.com/rbates) publishes a weekly screencast on Rails. If you do work with Rails (or want to) you absolutely must subscribe to this podcast. 

Recent interesting episodes: 

1. [Pry with Rails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/280-pry-with-rails)
1. [Understanding the Asset Pipeline](http://railscasts.com/episodes/279-understanding-the-asset-pipeline)

Others that I occasionaly listen to: 

1. [This Developers Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) - Great developer stories. 
1. [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) - This used to be one of my top 5, but it has fallen off the radar for me.
1. [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/) - Really good Ruby discussion on a single topic or two per week. 
1. [VimCasts](http://vimcasts.org/) - I continue to be shocked at what can be done in Vim.
1. [Startups For the Rest of Us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) - If you are a developer and want to build your own startup, you can't go wrong with this one.
