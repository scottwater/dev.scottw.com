I wanted to pass a parameter into a rake task which uses a format like this:

<pre><code class="bash">
task :name, :first do  |t, args|
  puts "Hello #{args[:first]}"
end
</code></pre>

To execute the task:

<pre><code class="bash">
rake name[Scott]
</code></pre>

However, I kept getting an error that ZSH could not find the command. It turns out, I was tripping over ZSH’s globbing feature.

Thankfully, adding a simple alias resolved the issue for me:

<pre><code class="bash">
alias rake='noglob rake'
</code></pre>

I probably wasted an hour trying to figure out why ZSH didn’t like my rake task. Hopefully this post saves you from doing the same.
