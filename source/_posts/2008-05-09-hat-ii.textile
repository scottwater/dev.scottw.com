We had our "second Telligent Hack-A-Thon":http://communityserver.com/news/team-blog/community-server-hack-a-thon/ last week when the product team was in town to celebrate the release of "Community Server 2008":http://communityserver.com.

The objective was pretty simple: Create something useful using the new "Community Server 2008 web service layer":http://api.communityserver.org/ in about 20 hours. Sleep was optional.

The team did some amazing work ("videos":http://communityserver.com/news/team-blog/community-server-hack-a-thon/). It will take us a couple of weeks, but we are working on a site to host the code/samples/videos from this hack-a-thon and other similar internal events. Maybe we should do a public event or two?
