Terrific quote by [Joshua Ballanco](https://twitter.com/manhattanmetric) on an otherwise [silly hacker news thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3670857):

> ...people don't remember that a feature was missing once you implement it, but they remember broken features long after you've fixed them.
