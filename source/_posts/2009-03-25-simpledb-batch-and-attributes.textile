I am still not a huge fan of SimpleDB API (especially via Amazon's C# wrapper), but with Microsoft's decision to "change course on SDS":http://scottw.com/software/sds2/, if you need a cloud scale queryable schemaless entity store, it is likely your best option.

Recently they announced to "two major changes":http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2009/03/amazon-simpledb-batch-put.html:

# Batching - lets you insert 25 items in a single transaction (transaction being the key word).
# An increase from 250 million items per domain to 1 billion.

I am really looking forward to the next couple of months in this space. It is obvious that "Amazon":http://aws.amazon.com has stepped up its game since Microsoft has gone public with the "Azure":http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx initiative and you have to imagine things are just getting started.

Big competition FTW.
