I am a big fan of "1Password":http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password which does a killer job of managing my passwords. In addition to managing passwords, it will also generate new (very) strong passwords when it is time to register for a new site or service. Today, because of either an issue with the "Digg":http://digg.com password retrieval system or "Telligent":http://telligent.com email spam tools I needed to create a new account on Digg.

The sign up process is very simple, but I was shocked when I received the follow warning (emphasis is mine):

bq. Passwords must be at least six characters and can contain *only numbers and letters*

I do not see why you would ever want to limit users from using stronger passwords. Does this make sense to anyone?
