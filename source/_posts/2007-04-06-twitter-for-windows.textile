It looks like I have managed to get a couple of people to jump on the "Twitter":http://twitter.com/ wagon (well, I guess the tons of press probably had something to do with it.)

Even though Twitter is insanely simple, there are a variety of ways to interact with it. Out of the box you get:

* Web
* SMS
* IM (GTalk/Jabber and AOL)

Most of my twittering on Windows has been via the web. However with a nice and simple API available, there are a couple Windows clients available.

Tonight I tried three of them:

# "triQQr":http://triqqr.de/ - This is a very new tool. Simple to use, but still needs some polish.
# "Twitteroo":http://www.freakitude.com/2007/03/19/twitteroo-twitter-client-for-windows/ - Installed easily and posted as expected. However, it seemed to get stuck fetching recent updates so I moved on.
# "TwitBox":http://www.winextra.com/2007/04/02/twitbox-053-bug-squasher-release/ - Very simple to use tool, no install required, see details below.

It looks like I am going to stick with TwitBox. It is super easy to use, seems to do a good job of keeping itself updated, and has some very helpful keyboard shortcuts. So far, the only thing that is missing is some kind of "TinyUrl":http://tinyurl.com integration.

Does anyone have any other suggestions?

BTW, for those of you using a BlackBerry, the GTalk integration is really nice. If you are like me and do not have an unlimited SMS plan, this can save you some cash.

*Update:*

I just gave another two applications a quick try.

# "Twitterlicious":http://www.ejecutive.co.uk/projects/twitterlicious - This is very nice and lightweight. Not as feature rich as Twitbox, but very usable. If Twitbox is too much for you, Twitterlicious should do the trick.
# "Twitter WPF":http://blogs.vertigo.com/personal/alanl/Blog/default.aspx - This one looks promising, but I could not get it run. It installed (via Onclick) nicely, asked for my credentials, and now dies whenever it starts. I will give this one another try in a couple of weeks.
