!<http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591840767.01._AA_SCTZZZZZZZ_.jpg(View Think Big Act Small)!:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/1591840767&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=tripleasp-20&amp;creative=9325 This summer, instead of writing frequently I chose to spend most of my free time reading. Overall, I probably managed to squeeze in about 10 books. By far my favorite has been Jason Jennings, "_"Think Big Act Small":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/1591840767&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=tripleasp-20&amp;creative=9325_".

TBAS highlights nine super performing companies and their common traits. This is an approach that has been done quite a few other times (I am also a big fan of Jim Collins "From Good to Great":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0066620996 &amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=tripleasp-20&amp;creative=9325), but the advice and lessons in TBAS IMO where not only practical, but could also be implemented in just about any other company (even on a per team level).

While "Telligent":http://telligent.com" is still a very small company in the grand scheme of things, we have been growing an a phenomenal rate. TBAS has really opened my eyes to ways I can help keep that small company feel and culture while we manage to grow by leaps and bounds on a monthly basis (it also doesn't hurt that "Rob":http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward has read and liked the book as well :).

TBAS is also a very easy read, so even if you generally do not enjoy Business/Management type books, I think you will really enjoy this one.
