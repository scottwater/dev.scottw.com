As I have previously mentioned, I am a very big fan of "Windows Live Writer":http://scottw.com/software/windows-live-writer/. I had not yet setup a code formatting plugin on my Fusion VM, so I hit Google and found the this "great little plugin":http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d4409446-af7f-42ec-aa20-78aa5bac4748&amp;bt=9&amp;pl=8.

It generates quite a bit of embedded css &amp; markup, but if used sparingly it should make reading code in a blog post much more rewarding.  Of course one other option would be move the style to the CSS file, but then that makes RSS a second class citizen and hurts your most loyal readers.

Anyone else using another solution? Or plugin?
