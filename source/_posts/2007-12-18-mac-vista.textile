I saw the new Mac vs. PC guy ad "misprint":http://www.apple.com/getamac/ which stated the fastest Vista laptop tested this year was the MacBook Pro, so I had to give it a shot.

bq. The fastest Windows Vista notebook we've tested this year (through 10/25/07) is a Mac. Try that again: The fastest Windows Vista notebook we've tested this year -- or for that matter, ever -- is a Mac. Not a Dell, not a Toshiba, not even an Alienware.

I first did the test as a virtual machine, but the graphics score was pretty low (I think a 1.9). I then did the same test running it directly on "BootCamp":http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bootcamp.html" and got a 5.1. The lowest scored item was memory. It does haves  4 gigs of RAM, but on 32 bit only ~ 3 gigs are recognized. If 64 bit drivers are released, I might give it another shot. Still, 5.1 is not too bad, especially on a Mac. :)
