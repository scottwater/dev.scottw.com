Unnecessary options kill usability and cost you money.

On Sunday, I wanted to look up the hours of my local Goodyear. However, since the closest Goodyear is slightly more than 10 miles away it required me to search a second time.

There is absolutely no reason for this.

* A second search gives me an opportunity to just walk away.
* Is there really a difference between 10 and 11 miles?
* Why not just display the locations sorted by the closest? 
* Do users really need the millage? Has this ever saved a sale? 

Just because you have the information and can present a choice doesn't mean your users need it. 

Be selfish, *keep the options to yourself*.
