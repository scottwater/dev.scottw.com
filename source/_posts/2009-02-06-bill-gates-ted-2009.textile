Whether you love or hate Microsoft, it is hard to not be impressed with what Bill Gates was able to build in the 25 years or so he spent building the Microsoft. However, my respect for what he has done at Microsoft is very small compared to my respect for what he is now doing with his life via his foundation.

In his "20 minute talk at TED 2009":http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_unplugged.html, he covers two of the important problems he is trying to solve via his foundation:

# How do we stop a deadly disease that is spread my mosquitoes?
# How do you make a teacher great?

My favorite quote: "_I am an optimist. I believe any problem can be solved_".

If you have 20 minutes, I highly recommend watching the video. Bill has the money (and now time) to do a lot of good, but that good can only happen when many more get involved.
