This goes into the, _I way overthought this pile_. 

I recently setup a new development machine and for the first time needed to setup an existing "heroku":http://heroku.com site.

The heroku docs have helpful tips for "cloning your site":http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/collab and setting it up locally (under collaboration).

However, since I store my source on other services ("github":http://github.com/scottwater and "trunks":http://trunksapp.com) I was sure there was something more complicated I needed to do.

Well, it turns out there really isn't anything to do. Simply add your heroku repository as a remote and you are done: 

<pre><code class="bash">
git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:APPNAME.git
</code></pre>

_NOTE:_ technically if this is your first time using git on the box you will also need to install in the git gem and and login/authenticate. Otherwise you are good to go. 

Long live git and tools which build on top of it. :)
