Some of these are really good: 

* Donâ€™t ask for permission (no IMO/IMHO)
* Write a lot
* Write everyday (even if you don't publish it)

...others not so much. Still worth the read even if all you take away from it is you are probably simply over thinking all the reasons for not writing & publishing.
