I received an email this morning from Amazon announcing their new ""Amazon Green":http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=394379011&amp;tag=scottwater-20" initiative.

bq. Help shoppers discover the benefits of going Green. Amazon.com has launched Amazon Green, a cross-category program that includes a list of products that customers have selected as the best green products offered by Amazon.com and a place for customers to discover Amazon's entire green product selection.

One the surface, even though it is clearly a sales ploy, I love to see them putting energy behind helping the environment. In addition, the social aspect asking users to vote on which "green products you wish everyone had" is a very nice touch.

However, irony here is hard to overlook. As someone who has made a lot of "Amazon purchases over the years":http://scottw.com/life/amazon-prime/ it is hard for me to take them very serious here. They still routinely use huge boxes and plastic filler packs for small orders. Even my Kindle arrived in a huge box.

So while I think it is a nice concept, if Amazon really want to show a commitment to the environment, I hope they eventually start from with in.
