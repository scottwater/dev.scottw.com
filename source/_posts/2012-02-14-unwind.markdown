[Unwind](https://github.com/scottwater/unwind) has a single goal. Take a url and figure out what it actually points to.

It is able to walk various redirect status codes, handles relative and absolute locations, and a couple of other gotchas. 

Once completed you have the destination url and a list of the hops along the way. 

``` ruby
require 'unwind'

follower = Unwind::RedirectFollower.resolve('http://j.mp/Ai8S1s')
assert_equal 'http://www.scottw.com/unwind', follower.final_url 
```

**Hat Tip:** This gem started with code from [John Nunemaker's](http://twitter.comjnunemaker) [Following Redirects with Net/HTTP](http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/03/04/following-redirects-with-nethttp/) which provided the basic code to get this done.
