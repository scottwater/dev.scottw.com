Looks like Facebook just added one of FriendFeed's best features, "Like".

bq. We've just introduced an easy way to tell friends that you like what they're sharing on Facebook with one easy click. Wherever you can add a comment on your friends' content, you'll also have the option to click "Like" to tell your friends exactly that: "I like this.":http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=53024537130

I personally prefer the concept of "liking" over ratings. I think it is a much easier decision for users to participate when the choice is yes/no (or this case just yes) vs. on a scale of 1 to 5, what would you rate this item. I would love to see us eventually take this approach in Community Server as well.
