"Apple iPad will fail in the enterprise: Dell":http://www.cio.com.au/article/381337/apple_ipad_will_fail_enterprise_dell/

bq. Apple is great if you’ve got a lot of money and live on an island. It’s not so great if you have to exist in a diverse, open, connected enterprise; simple things become quite complex.

Loosely translated, _"we are going to build crap and sell it to the people watching the books"_. 

Dell still does not get it. No one wants to get a Dell (anything)[1]. You might tolerate Dell. You might begrudgingly work on one of their machines, but nobody actually wakes up and says, "I hope I get a new Dell product today". 

Customers talk to each other online. Everyday they talk to each other more. Companies like Dell who ignore end users will continue to decline. 

fn1. OK, their monitors are actually pretty good.
