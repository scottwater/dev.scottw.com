I guess some bad things can happen if a hosts file is changed without the user's knoweledge. However, the number of steps required to do this on Windows Vista is a little over the top and cost me some valuable time this morning.

Before we go through the Vista steps, lets take a look at how you did this in previous versions of Windows and OS X.

*Windows XP and Windows 2003*

# Navigate to Windows > System32 > Drivers > etc
# Open the file (with no extension) hosts
# Make your changes and save the file.

*OS X*

# Navigate to /etc
# Open hosts (no extension) in your favorite editor (TextMate for me)
# Make your changes and save the file.
# OS X will then ask you for an administrator password before saving the file

*Widows Vista*

# Navigate to Windows > System32 > Drivers > etc
# Make a copy of this file and paste it some where else since you are no longer allowed to directly edit the file (I am guessing you could do a save as in step 3 as well)
# Open the file, make your changes, and save the file.
# Make a copy of your updated file and paste it over the original which brings up the new Vista copy dialog

# Next, you are warned that you need to be an administrator to make this change.

# Finally, you get to the UAC screen which again requires the same confirmation as the previous step.

There are three steps in Windows XP and Window 2003 and a fourth in OS X. In an effort to add the fourth (security) step to Vista, they have added an additional 3 steps (4 if you count the fact you may need to restart your browser to see the changes).

We are not talking about a lot of extra work here, but IMO, this is complication for complication sake. Why not just show the UAC message when I try to save the file? Why show a dialog before UAC which essentially tells me the warns me about same thing UAC is warning me about?

I spent way too much time trying to get this to work early this morning, so hopefully this little rant helps someone else out in the future and is a reminder to everyone who designs software to remember even if they are simple steps, less is always better.
