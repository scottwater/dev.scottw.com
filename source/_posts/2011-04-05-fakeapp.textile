bq. Fake is a new browser for Mac OS X that makes web automation simple. Fake allows you to drag discrete browser Actions into a graphical Workflow that can be run again and again without human interaction. The Fake Workflows you create can be saved, reopened, and shared.

Or put another way, if you do the same thing in a browser over and over, Fake will help you automate the task and a beautifully simple way.

From a developer point of view, Fake won't take the place of good tests, but it is a great way to automate annoying and often repetitive testing work flows (plus it is nice to see the test walk through).

At $30, if you value your time, it is a steal.
