bq. Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions.

If you want a consistent color/feel/style across a wide variety of editors and tools, Solarized is perfect. I am currently using it in MacVim, vim (console), terminal, and textmate. It is a big update to some of my previous themes (especially terminal).
