I am new to the "Apple FanBoy world":http://scottw.com/search/mac/, so I am still feeling my way around the rumors and speculations of what will be announced at next week's "WWDC":http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/.

I have no rumors to post, so instead, I am just going to post a wish list.

* 3g iPhone. This looks like a forgone conclusion. I "love my first generation model":http://scottw.com/technology/iphone-vs-blackberry/, so I will order v2 as soon as I am given the opportunity.
* 13 inch MBP - I love my 15 inch MBP, but I would love to shave 1 or 2 pounds off of it. Since I use a monitor most of the time, I don't think I would be giving up too much (a beefier MBA would be welcomed as well).
* Apple TV - My dad bought on 3 months ago and I have been very impressed by its simplicity. Since Apple has been stuck on 40 and 160 gig models, I am trying to be patient and wait for them to release a hardware upgrade.
