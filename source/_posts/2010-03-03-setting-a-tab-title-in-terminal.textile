I have been spending a lot more time in terminal recently. I routinely find myself having more tabs open than I can keep track of.

I then end up forgetting what's open and end up opening even more tabs which just make the problem worse.

I finally got tired of this and "posted a quick question on Twitter":http://twitter.com/scottw/status/9900627749. While waiting for a twitter response, I figured I would finally checkout "SuperUser":http://superuser.com which of course "had the answer":http://superuser.com/questions/105499/change-terminal-title-in-osx.

You just need to execute the following command:

<pre><code class="bash">
echo -n -e "\033]0;YOUR TAB TITLE HERE\007"
</code></pre>


Since there is no way I will remember that command (and who should) I wrapped it in a function that I can put in my .bash_profile.

<pre><code class="bash">
function title(){
	echo -n -e "\033]0;$1\007"
}
</code></pre>

Now, in any tab, I just need to execute:

<pre><code class="bash">
title 'My Tab Title'
</code></pre>
