A really interesting (short) talk by "Patrick McKenzie":http://www.kalzumeus.com/, _"Marketing to minorities":http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/03/26/software-for-underserved-markets/_

Two things that really jumped out at me:

# Benefits instead of Features (software is boring)
# You should be in the emotion business
