I found this line very interesting in "Entrepreneurs Can Lead Us Out of the Crisis":http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123544318435655825.html:

bq. _Only entrepreneurs have the flexibility, the freedom and the risk-everything ambition to find the path back to prosperity in a rapidly changing, technology-driven global economy._

I am more than a little biased to the side of entrepreneurs, but I think there is a lot of merit to the article which goes on to highlight other relatively simple things such as reducing payroll taxes which could help provide the necessary incentives to make creating startups more appealing.

Ignoring the politics (and please do so in the comments), IMO, what is really needed to turn this ship around is a change in expectations. Forcing the creation of jobs in areas we are doing fine is not a long term solution. I would much rather see us invest in ideas and allow them to drive the rest.

Thoughts?
