The PostgreSQL formula for "homebrew":https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew has already been updated to version 9.

Thankfully, with a little help "from google":https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/issue/2802, I found "Adam Vandenberg's":https://github.com/adamv 8.4 formula.

<pre><code class="bash">
brew update
brew install
http://github.com/adamv/homebrew/raw/versions/Library/Formula/postgresql8.rb
</code></pre>
