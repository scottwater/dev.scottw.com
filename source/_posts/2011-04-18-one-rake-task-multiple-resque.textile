First, here is a "nice blog post":http://blog.leshill.org/blog/2011/04/03/using-resque-and-resque-scheduler-on-heroku.html by "Les Hill":http://blog.leshill.org/ on running both "Resque Scheduler":https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler and regular Resque workers on Heroku (on the cheap :).

One frustrating thing about this setup was manually starting each instance of resque (I needed at least 2; 1 for the scheduler and 1 to do work) for _local development_. A little googling around led me to this very helpful gist, _"Rake task to launch multiple Resque workers":https://gist.github.com/486161_, by "Karel Minarik":https://github.com/karmi. 

I changed line number 133 to use my "jobs:work" task which always starts the scheduler first, but everything else works as is.

Now, all I need to do is execute rake workers:start and I get three instances of resque running (1 scheduler and 2 workers). 

*UPDATE:* Looks like I edited out the part of this post which mentions this is for local development. The AutoScale code in Les's post takes care of this in production (on Heroku).
