I am on the market for a new WYSIWYG editor. By far the most important feature is something that is super light weight (and yes, it does need to be WYSIWYG).

So far, my personal favorite is the "pages" editor found in Google Groups. It does the really important things and has a very small foot print. I really wish this is part of their web tool kit.

Do you have any suggestions? Has anyone seen something like the Google Group editor?
