We are still three days away from officially starting "in.Telligent":http://in.telligent.com, but things are starting to come together nicely.

* Yesterday we received word that the event has officially sold out at ~ 200 attendees. This doubles last years number.
* The product team spent a good 30 minutes last night driving around looking for "http://www.sonnybryans.com/":http://www.sonnybryans.com/. iPhone GPS took us through a residential neighborhood and in the end directed us to an out of business location. We ended up at going to Red Hot and Blue (as usual).
* Product team presentation war room:

* "Scott Dockendorf":http://scottdock.com, VP of Client Services, does a make up dry run for his talks
