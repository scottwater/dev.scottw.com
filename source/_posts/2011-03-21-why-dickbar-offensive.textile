Very well put by "Marco Arment":http://www.marco.org, "Why the Quick Bar (“dickbar”) is still so offensive":http://www.marco.org/3991237704

bq. It’s offensive because it’s deeply bad, showing complete disregard for quality, product design, and user respect, and we’ve come to expect a lot more from Twitter.

I have simply removed Twitter (all apps) from my iPhone. Life is too short for crappy experiences.
