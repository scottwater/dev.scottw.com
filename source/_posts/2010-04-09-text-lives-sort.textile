If you are seeing this post, it means you are visiting my new home on the Intertubes - "ScottW.com":http://scottw.com.

I have owned ScottW.com for a while, so I figured it was time to actually put it to use. Since I was going to make a change, I figured I would take the time to clean some things up and simplify the site.

# I removed a bunch of posts which are no longer relevant (example: open positions). I am going to try to push content that is date sensitive over to my "tumblr blog":http://scottw.me. 
# The site is now generated by "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com, powered by "Rack-Jekyll":http://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll, and hosted on "Heroku":http://heroku.com. This means I can write it in a simple text editor and then publish it easily via git. 
# I am going without comments for now. If you have questions or comments you can email me at "scottwater@gmail.com":mailto:scottwater@gmail.com or use the "ask":http://scottw.me/ask feature on Tumblr.
# Blog posts about blogs are lame, so I am going to stop here. I really just wanted to callout the new url and apologize for unread posts you may be seeing in your aggregator. Sorry. :(

If you want to see how it is all put together and works, you can grab a copy of it from "my git":http://github.com/scottwater/ "repository":http://github.com/scottwater/scottw_com_blog.
