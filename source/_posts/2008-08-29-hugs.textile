I saw this "video":http://blip.tv/file/1061088 on "CodeSqueeze":http://www.codesqueeze.com/hug-a-developer/ earlier today. Way too good not to share on a Friday.

The video was produced by "DevShop":http://devshop.com/, which is a software project tracking application. DevShop looks interesting. Anyone have any experience with it?
