A couple of weeks ago, I started a new **open blog** called "OpenCraftBeer":http://opencraftbeer.com. 

What I mean by open is that anyone can contribute to it. Think of it as a craft beer wiki that is tightly moderated to prevent spam. 

Most user submissions will be simple beer reviews, but any kind of content which craft beer drinkers would find helpful is welcomed. 

So if you like great beer (and really, who doesn't?), please check out one or more of the following links: 

* "OpenCraftBeer":http://opencraftbeer.com
* "OpenCraftBeer RSS Feed":http://feeds.opencraftbeer.com/opencraftbeer
* "OpenCraftBeer on Twitter":http://twitter.com/opencraftbeer
* "OpenCraftBeer on Facebook":http://j.mp/FBOCB

Finally, if you have anything to contribute, just send an email to review@opencraftbeer.com.

**UPDATE**

The review@opencraftbeer.com address should contain the exact content you wish to publish (all content is reviewed first).

If you have any comments or questions about the site, please email me directly at scottwater@gmail.com.
