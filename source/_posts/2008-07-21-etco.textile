"Windows Live Writer":http://scottw.com/software/windows-live-writer/ is still best desktop blogging tool on the "market", but as the name implies it only works on Windows.

I had been "using TextMate":http://scottw.com/software/mac-blogging-options/ for a while, but I have been wanting something a bit richer.

After a bit of debugging and testing, I was finally able to get "Ecto":http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/ to support slugs, extended entries, and tags by leveraging the Moveable Type and Wordpress versions of the MetaBlog API.

I am still hoping to get MarsEdit to work properly but its requirement to use the mt.setCategories method after saving post content and before publishing might be a deal breaker.

These changes will be available in v.Next of "Graffiti":http://graffiticms.com.
