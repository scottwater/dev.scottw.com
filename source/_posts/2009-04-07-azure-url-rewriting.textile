Just noticed the this on a "Steve Marx":http://blog.smarx.com/ blog post about "PHP and Azure":http://blog.smarx.com/posts/php-asp-net-in-windows-azure

bq.    _One thing we've enabled in the new CTP that's somewhat buried in the rest of the announcements is support for the IIS URL Rewrite module. Using that, I got nice URLs like "http://tweval.com/mix09-smarx.php":http://tweval.com/mix09-smarx.php to map to the uglier "http://tweval.com/index.php?tag=mix09-smarx":http://tweval.com/index.php?tag=mix09-smarx.

It is nice to see them reuse the "IIS URL Rewrite":http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/460/using-url-rewrite-module/ (although I would rather have the mod rewrite file format instead of XML) module although with MVC + Routes this is probably a bit moot, but still nice to have for some more complicated scenarios.
