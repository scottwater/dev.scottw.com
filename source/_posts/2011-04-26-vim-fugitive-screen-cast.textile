I did not really see benefit of "Vim Fugitive":https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive until after I watched this excellent screen cast, "Fugitive.vim - a complement to command line git":http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/. 

If you use vim and git, you *need* fugitive.
