This post initially started as a set of notes related to my own research around NHibernate and Linq to SQL. However, it quickly turned into a very obvious "ah ha" moment.

As I have previously mentioned, I have been doing a lot of "research lately on various tools":http://scottw.com/code/castle/. One area I have focused on recently is data access. This is an area of hot debate for many people and can easily turn into a pissing match, so I first want to share my key take away:

*The tool in itself, does not matter. It is all about what you are comfortable with.*

In hindsight, this is very obvious. It is generally the answer to most developer questions (C# vs. VB, SQL Server vs. MySQL, ASP.Net vs. Rails). There will always be trade offs. The result will never be perfect.

This of course does not mean you shouldn't try anything new. The world of software is in constant flux. I routinely cringe at code I wrote a year ago. However, if you spend all your time looking for the perfect solution, you won't leave yourself the necessary time to build something great.

FYI, if you are still interested in the NHibernate vs Linq to SQL, here is a "nice overview":http://www.callcontext.com/archive/2008/04/04/1163.aspx by "Geoff Bennet":http://www.callcontext.com/.
