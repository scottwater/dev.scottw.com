![Bart Simpson writing on chalkboard](http://assets.scottw.com/bi/bart.gif "I will never send an email from no-reply ever again")

NEVER, EVER, EVER, NEVER SEND A CUSTOMER AN EMAIL SHE CANNOT REPLY TO. 

Why miss the opportunity to engage with your (would be) customer? Why make them jump through even a single hoop to contact you?

I wrote about this a while ago on the [KickoffLabs](http://www.kickofflabs.com) blog as well: [Email Is Never Just a Notification](http://blog.kickofflabs.com/email-is-not-a-notification).
