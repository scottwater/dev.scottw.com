Microsoft announced yesterday that they are going to offer very low cost hosted versions of "Exchange and SharePoint":http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1474. 

bq. For Microsoft resellers that had been fearing Microsoft would drop the bottom out of the hosted-services business with its Microsoft Online services offerings, their nightmares were realized on July 8. Microsoft is planning to sell Microsoft-hosted Exchange and SharePoint for $3 per user per month. The quote above (with a little help from "Rob":http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward) reminded me of an essay in my favorite book, ""The Big Moo":http://www.sethgodin.com/bigmoo/".

bq. Every organization that gets into trouble falters because it waited too long to do the stuff that should have been done a long  time ago. Panic early, not late, and your ï¬re drills will actually pay off.
