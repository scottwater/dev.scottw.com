Here is an updated list of the tools I use daily to try and make development both simple and enjoyable.

<!--more-->

[iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) - I practically live in this thing. As I said before, [iterm2 is absolutely dope](http://www.scottw.com/why-iterm-dope).

[MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) - I am back to using MacVim more than vim in iTerm2. I still copy and paste lazily and MacVim feeds that laziness.

[MockSMTP](http://mocksmtpapp.com/) - I know there are some free browser alternatives, but this thing is so damn simple to use, I love it. 

[CharlesProxy](http://www.charlesproxy.com/) - If you really need to dig into a request, CharesProxy rocks (and no, the browser developer tools don't count).

[HomeBrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) - install just about anything you need for development with ease. 

[OS X GCC installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer) - works perfectly with Homebrew and removes the need to install Xcode. My only recent issue with this was the rb-fsevent gem which appears to look for Xcode. You can fix that (temporarily) by using this branch: pre-compiled-gem-one-off

[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) - I have only had a couple minor issues with RVM, so I decided to give rbenv a try. I have been using it for 3 to 4 weeks and so far it has been great (and solid).

[pow](http://pow.cx/) - I don't use Pow as much for active rails development (restarting rails too slow) but when you need to run multiple websites that interact locally it is amazing. In addition, it is a great way to host small local apps (like this blog).

[zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) - sadly I am still noobish in the shell, but starting to get better. 

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) - What I really love about solarized is having a consistent set of colors across multiple tools (iTerm2, vim, macvim, textmate, etc.).
