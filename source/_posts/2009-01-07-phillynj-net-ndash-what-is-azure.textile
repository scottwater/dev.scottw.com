I am going to be giving a talk at the "PhillyNJ.NET":http://PhillyNJ.NET user group on Thursday January 15th on the topic of ""What is Azure":http://www.phillynj.net/home/meetings/2009-01-15.aspx".

As I have been writing about recently, "Azure":http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx is a massive undertaking by Microsoft. What I am hoping to do in this talk is paint a clear picture of:

* What is available
* Why you should care
* What you can do to start leveraging this platform.
