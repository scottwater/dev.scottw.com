I finally got a chance to spend some time with the "Spark View Engine":http://sparkviewengine.com/ by "Louis DeJardin":http://whereslou.com/. While I am sure I am just scratching the surface on what you can be accomplished with it, I can say without a doubt I am already in love.

It is going to take me a while longer to fully grok all that it can do, but the mixture of power and convention is just beautiful. The documentation on it is fairly good, but it honestly does not do it justice. If you are using ASP.Net MVC, you owe yourself to spend some time with Spark.
