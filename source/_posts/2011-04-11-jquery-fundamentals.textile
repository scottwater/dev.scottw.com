"jQuery Fundamentals":http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html

bq. The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of the jQuery JavaScript library; when you're done with the book, you should be able to complete basic tasks using jQuery, and have a solid basis from which to continue your learning. This book was designed as material to be used in a classroom setting, but you may find it useful for individual study.

 In addition, even if you could care less about jQuery, chapter 2's discussion of scope and closures is a great read.
