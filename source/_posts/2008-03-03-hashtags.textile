I am getting ready to pack and head to Las Vegas in the morning for "Mix 08":http://visitmix.com/2008/. This year, while I am very interested to learn about all the new stuff that will get announced, meet some new people and see some familiar faces, there is another thing I am very interested to see play out, Mix + "Twitter":http://twitter.com.

In the past, someone would have created a big list of RSS feeds and allowed everyone to subscribe. However, via Twitter and "Hashtags":http://hashtags.org/ I think there is a better option for keeping up with what's going on at the conference this year.

bq. Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They're like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post. You create a hashtag simply by prefixing a word with a hash symbol: #hashtag. ["Twitter Wiki":http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags]

To enable hashtags on your account, you need to follow the "http://twitter.com/hashtags":http://twitter.com/hashtags twitter bot. Once you are have done that, just include -<strike>#mix</strike>- #Mix08 anywhere in your tweet and it will show up on the following page "http://hashtags.org/tag/mix08/":http://hashtags.org/tag/mix08/.

And of course, feel free to "follow me":http://twitter.com/scottw.

*Update: It looks like folks are using the tag #Mix08 instead of #mix.*.
