[Osfoora](http://osfoora.com/mac/) is a new'ish Twitter client for the Mac. 

Overall, it is a very polished app that works extremely well. It has all the features you would expect in a great Mac Twitter client: 

1. Multiple account support
1. Lots of keyboard short cuts
1. Growl notifications (if you are into that)
1. Instapaper integration (it's about the links)
1. Good inline image previews

However, there are some things which drive me nuts and I hope get fixed/updated/implemented:

1. No easy way to scroll to the top. I really don't need to read or scroll through all tweets. The lack of support for Command+ArrowUp catches me off guard all the time. 
1. No keyboard short cut for reporting spam and/or blocking someone. Direct missile support would be nice as well.
1. You can mute users (nice) but muting keywords would be better. I am really hoping to avoid seeing even a single SXSW tweet. Help!
1. No drag drop on images. Similar to scrolling I try this daily because it is just supposed to work in every Mac app. 
1. If you are going to support Url shorteners, skipping bit.ly is a big oversight. 

Despite the list above, I still highly recommend it. $5 is a small price to pay for something as nicely put together as Osfoora.

And of course, don't forget you can find me way too often on Twitter at [@scottw](http://twitter.com/scottw).
