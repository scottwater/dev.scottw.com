This post should serve as my own quick start guide for [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

> Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model. 

Here is all you need to know: 

First, start here: [Why aren't you using git-flow?](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)

Then install via: brew install git-flow (read the docs on [git-flow github](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) for how to install on other platforms)

Finally, some helpful git short cuts: 

	fs = flow feature start
	ff = flow feature finish
	
With these short cuts in place, you can use git-flow for new features like this:

	git fs login
	git ff login
