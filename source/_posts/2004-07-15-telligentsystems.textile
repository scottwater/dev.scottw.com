Today was my "first official day":http://www.telligentsystems.com/About/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9 at my new position with "Telligent Systems":http://www.telligentsystems.com/. This has been in the works for a while now and ended up being a pretty good secret outside of Canada (sorry, inside joke). I feel privledged to work with a great team of individuals who have not only excelled at their day jobs, but have spent many hours contributing to various open source projects.

In the past it has been pretty easy to move from one job to another. But as I start to learn more about what I am looking for in an employer, it gets harder to leave. IHS was a great place to work and I learned quite a bit during my couple years with them. But the more I talked to "Rob":http://rob-howard.net/ about his vision for "Telligent Systems":http://www.telligentsystems.com/, the more I was sure I wanted to be part of it.
