I finally got tired of manually generating test data and spent a couple of minutes with the "Faker":https://github.com/stympy/faker (actually I went with the "ffaker":https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/ffaker version) gem.

This goes into the _I should have done that sooner_ bucket. 

I set up a couple of rake tasks (fake:small, fake:medium, fake:large) and added a bit of randomness to the script. 

It might just be me, but I find it refreshing to work with actual data and for a pre-release, you really can't beat Faker.
