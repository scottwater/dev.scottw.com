After swearing off Outlook a couple of years and finally freeing myself from the tyranny of Exchange[1], I really did not expect to be using a native email client anytime soon.

However, that quickly changed after using "Sparrow":http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/.

Things I really like about Sparrow (and the recent 1.1 update):

* It is small and minimal
* Labels are easily accessible, but out of the way by default
* Supports priority inbox (which has worked really well for me)
* Easy access to multiple inboxes

If you use Gmail[2] from a Mac, I highly recommend checking it out. There are free (lite) and commercial editions available in the Mac AppStore. 

fn1. Telligent used Exchange for email.

fn2. Sparrow 1.1 added generic IMAP support, but I have not used it.
