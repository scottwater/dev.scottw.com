This is much simpler than most related articles make it (and good luck finding it in Amazon's own documentation). 

# Name your bucket the url you want to use for the cname. 
# Set up a cname to s3.amazonaws.com. 
# Grant the "everyone" role "view permissions" for the bucket. 

For example, I created a bucket called assets.scottw.com. I then entered a cname record for assets and pointed it to the url s3.amazonaws.com. Now any file I upload to the assets.scottw.com bucket is available at the same corresponding url.
